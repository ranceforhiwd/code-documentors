# code-documentors
This repo is useful for developers who would like to document their source code for php and js.  The process starts two docker containers for PHPDocumentor 3 and JsDocs.  The script will pull source code from a remote repository, document the code, then commit changes to the documentation repository.
<p>Software development projects can be large with extremely complex functionality so managing them can be very difficult without a good road map, dedicated project management software, and effective processes such as Agile. One feature of software projects, often overlooked, are good tech libraries with detailed discussions, notes, and indexes for files, functions, and events.  Yes, git repositories document code using commit ids and pull requests however these kinds of documentation are rarely returned to after merges are performed, conflicts are resolved, and deployments are made. </p>
<p>Many times developers re-invent routines, classes, or entire programs within the same organizations because of the lack of developers’ documentation. As developers, we have no problems reading others blog posts, documents, and GitHub projects to get the answers or understanding what we need at that time.  Documenting processes or commenting code are practices that should be re-invented, especially developers early in their careers or experienced developers new to the project and codebase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phpdoc.org/">PHP Documentor</a> and <a href="https://jsdoc.app/">JSDOCS</a> are two programs developers can use to automatically document their code and build tech libraries as projects are completed.  One goal in a developer’s shop is to find reusable code that could be used to build larger software components or assemblies.  This kind of documentation helps establish coding standards, best practices, and communicate parts of the software still in development or stages of testing.  Managers can perform better code reviews and developers can examine their own code in greater detail and context for possible improvements.</p>
